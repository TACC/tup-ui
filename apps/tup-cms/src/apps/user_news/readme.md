# User Updates

This is a short-term app to list User Updates from an API. The API in use is a proxy of an API that may change. In fact, this app could be replaced by a different app. The future is uncertain. But, this app uses TACC Core-Styles `c-news` UI pattern, so a new app can use the same classnews in its makrup to retain the styles of this app. Alternatively, if the markup is not under our immediate control, we can use Core-Styles to create styles for the new app's markup, and those styles would `@extend` `c-news` classes.
