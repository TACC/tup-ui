# Tacc

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

Local dev setup:

1.  `npm install` to install Javascript dependencies and the Nx build tool.
2.  `npx nx build tup-css` to build the styles.
3.  `npx nx build tup-ui` to build the TUP UI.
4.  `npx nx build tup-cms` to build the CMS container.
5.  `npx nx serve tup-cms` to serve the CMS backend.
6.  `npx nx serve tup-ui` in another terminal tab to serve the React frontend.
7.  Run Django migrations:

- a) `docker exec -it tup_cms /bin/bash`
- b) `python manage.py migrate`

8.  (if CMS assets change) Collect updated CMS assets:

- a) `docker exec -it tup_cms /bin/bash`
- b) `python manage.py python manage.py collectstatic --ignore assets/*/font*.css`

The TUP dashboard is accessed at http://localhost:8000/portal.
To bring containers down after development, run `npx nx down tup-cms`.

Other useful commands:

- `npx nx build core-components` to create a distributable library for the core components.

🔎 **Smart, Fast and Extensible Build System**

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nx/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nx/web`
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/angular`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `npm install --save-dev @nx/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nx/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nx/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@tacc/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nx/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `nx e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
