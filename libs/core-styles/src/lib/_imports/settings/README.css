Settings

These settings are for global variables e.g. custom properties and custom media queries. They are meant to be used by **many** other stylesheets. Examples include, but are not limited to, sizes and colors.

Reference:

- [Creative Bloq: Manage Large CSS Projects With ITCSS](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528) (find "Settings")

Rules:

- Custom media queries used by any files **must** be here.
- Custom properties, i.e. variables, used by many files **must** be here.
- Custom properties, i.e. variables, specific to one file should **not** be here.
