# TACC - Stylesheets - Search Bar

The search bar (as implemented in TACC/Core-CMS) _currently_ has a caveat (that will be resolved via TACC/Core-CMS#101).

Certain styles need to load **before** all search bar styles and markup:

```css
:host { visibility: hidden; height: 0; }
```

Certain styles need to load **after** all search bar styles and markup:

```css
:host { visibility: visible; height: auto; }
```

This avoids [FOUC] by hiding the search bar _until_ all styles and markup are loaded.
