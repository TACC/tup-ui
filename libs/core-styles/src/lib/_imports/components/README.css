Components

Components are finite, discrete, implementation-specific parts of an interface. Most people (users, designers, developers, stakeholders) would be able to identify them.

Reference:

- [BEM with Namespaces: Component Namespaces](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/#component-namespaces-c-)

Guidelines:

- Components are implementation-specific bits of UI.
- They are quite safe to modify.
- Anything with a leading `c-` is a specific thing.

Rules:

- One element may be styled by many components.
- One element may be styled by many modifiers of one component.
