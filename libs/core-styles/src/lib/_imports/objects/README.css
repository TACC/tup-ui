/* DO NOT ADD STYLES HERE; ADD THEM INSIDE STYLESHEETS IN THIS DIRECTORY */

/*
Object

Object are repetitive, shared, and purely-structural parts of an interface. They are seldom modified. Changing these styles may unintentionally break many layouts.

Reference:

- [BEM with Namespaces: Object Namespaces](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/#object-namespaces-o-)

Guidelines:

- Objects are abstract.
- They are often used for high-level layout management.
- Avoid modifying their styles.
- Be careful around anything with a leading `o-`.
