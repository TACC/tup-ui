Scopes

Scope styles are overrides and styles that are scoped to a specific area. These are meant to be used sparingly. Examples of scopes are styles for:
- third-party markup, e.g.:
    - social media widget
    - external authentication form
    - internal Bootstrap-dependent markup
- enforcing internal markup (e.g. breadcrumbs, form elements, document pages)
- WYSIWIG editor tags (e.g. CMS WYSIWIG content entry)
- coupled components (i.e. components interwoven in unique situations), e.g.:
    - Frontera homepage before all styling used plugins
    - article previews within an article list

Reference:

- [BEM with Namespaces: Scope Namespaces](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/#scope-namespaces-s-)

Guidelines:

- Scopes should be rare; evaluate before creating.
- A consistent way to author these in nested inside `.s-* {}`.

Rules:

- The `!important` may be used.
- All overrides **must** have a comment.
- Scope styles should have a comment.

/*
Utility

Utility styles exist to overwrite other styles. They are seldom modified. Example use case is one-time use on modules that are not meant to be extended to have the desired behavior.

Reference:

- [BEM with Namespaces: Utility Namespaces](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/#utility-namespaces-u-)

Guidelines:

- Utilities are style heavyweights.
- Alert people as to their existence.
- Never reassign to anything that carries a leading u-.

Rules:

- All other existing styles must be considered first.
- All other existing stylesheets must be considered first.
- Prefer this to inline styles.
